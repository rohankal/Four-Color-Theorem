The homework 3 submission includes 3 files which span two separate problems from this assignment. To test the Four-Color theorem problem, typing "make" will create an executable by the name of "coloring" which can be ran with the command "./coloring filename", where filename is replaced by the name of the textfile which holds the map. Running this executable will print out the letters and their respective colors to the console. For problem 2, there is a header file which includes the full implementation of a MinHeap using the STL's vector. This can be tested by making a separate test.cpp.
